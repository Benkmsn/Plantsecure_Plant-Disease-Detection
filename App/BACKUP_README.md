# backupApp.py

This is a simplified backup/test version of the main Flask application.

## Purpose
- Early development version
- Basic functionality testing
- Uses ResNet50 model instead of custom CNN
- Minimal routes for quick testing

## Status
⚠️ **Not for production use** - Use `app.py` instead

## Differences from main app.py:
1. Uses ResNet50 model architecture
2. No authentication system
3. No admin dashboard
4. No database integration
5. Simplified routes

## Usage
Only for reference or testing purposes. The main application is in `app.py`.

```bash
# To run (not recommended):
python backupApp.py
```

**Note:** This file is kept for historical/reference purposes. All active development is in `app.py`.
